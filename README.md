ML program and its classification via decision tree classification model 

Question2-
The dataset has been taken from -https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer
And the dataset is-https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DDwd9Tit-tfRgu9qfaqGY4XY74m-Mcta/view?usp=sharing

Question3-
The reason for me selecting Decision tree classification for given dataset is-

**On comparing the accuracy score with different models of classification it showed maximum accuracy
and hence for the given dataset it is the best fit model.**
-It is simple to understand as it follows the same process which a human follow while making any decision in real-life..
-It helps to think about all the possible outcomes for a problem.
-There is less requirement of data cleaning compared to other algorithms
-The logic behind the decision tree can be easily understood because it shows a tree-like structure.
